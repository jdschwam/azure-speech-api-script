## 📁 Generated Files
- `output/speech.wav` (183KB) - Working TTS output
- `output/aria_test.wav` (139KB) - Aria voice test
- `output/custom_test.wav` (98KB) - Custom rate/pitch test

## 🔧 Fixed Issues
1. ✅ Zsh coprocess errors (`read -p` → `echo` + `read`)
2. ✅ Read-only variable conflict (`status` → `recognition_status`)
3. ✅ Terminal compatibility (added `[[ -t 0 ]]` detection)
